Learning based Malicious Web Sites Detection using Suspicious URLs

**ABSTRACT**

Malicious Web sites largely promote the growth of Internet criminal activities and constrain the development of Web services. As a result, there has been strong motivation to develop systemic solution to stopping the user from visiting such Web sites. 

We propose a learning based approach to classifying Web sites into 2 classes: Benign and Malicious.

Our mechanism only analyzes the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) itself without accessing the content of Web sites. 
Thus, it eliminates the run-time latency and the possibility of exposing users to the browser based vulnerabilities.
By employing learning algorithms, our scheme achieves better performance on generality and coverage compared with blacklisting service.
